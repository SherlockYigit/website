# website
Welcome to the repository of my website, which I constantly start building from scratch when I'm bored!

## Installation
- You must install a [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (I think you should install the latest version.)
- `git clone https://github.com/SherlockYigit/website.git && cd website`
- `npm i` or (To use yarn, you must write a `npm i --global yarn && yarn add`)
### How I run this?
- fill in the `.env` file as needed.
- fill in the `config.js` file as needed. 
- `npm run <build,start,dev,format>` or `yarn <build,start,dev,format>`
